# ✨ AI-Powered Missing Person Identification System

🚀 Age-Invariant Face Recognition for Social Impact

 A smart platform that helps families, citizens & police locate missing persons using AI-driven face recognition 💙
 
 ## 📌 Why This Project Matters
 Every year thousands go missing — but faces change over time, making recognition difficult. Manual comparison is slow, inaccurate, and emotionally draining.

Our system automates this process using deep learning — comparing faces even when aging, lighting, or appearance has changed ✨
